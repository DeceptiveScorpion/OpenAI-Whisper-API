  "description": "This project is an API that uses OpenAI's Whisper API to convert audio files to text. The code uses a Node.js framework like Express.js and Multer to handle HTTP requests and file uploading. The code parses the incoming request from the client and extracts the audio file they want to convert to text. Then, it creates a FormData object and sets the model to OpenAI Whisper and adds the selected audio file to the object. A POST request is then made to the API to convert the audio file using OpenAI's Whisper API and extract the resulting text from the response. Finally, the uploaded audio file is deleted from the server. The server is run on a specific port (3000 or the value specified in the PORT environment variable) using Express.js.",
